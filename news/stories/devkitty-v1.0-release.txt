[title] Devkitty v1.0 Officially Released
[article]

## Devkitty v1.0 Is Here

After weeks of focused development, refinement, and testing, Devkitty reaches its first major milestone. The platform has been structured with long-term stability in mind, the documentation carefully prepared, and the engine rigorously stress-tested to ensure predictable, high-performance behavior. What began as a concept is now a complete, production-ready system.

Today, Devkitty v1.0 officially launches.

## What v1.0 Represents

Version 1.0 marks the first full public release of the Devkitty engine. A JavaScript-based vector asset system built for developers who want performance, control, and clean markup.

At its core, Devkitty introduces:

• The GGDK container format for bundling large icon packages  
• Strict, fail-loud parsing for predictable behavior  
• Canvas-based rendering powered by Path2D  
• The custom <dk-el> element for clean HTML usage  
• On-demand loading with multiple preload modes  
• A DOM free of inline SVG clutter  

Icons are stored in a structured GGDK file, fetched using the browser’s native fetch() API, indexed efficiently, and rendered only when requested. Hundreds of icons can live in a single file — without sacrificing performance or flooding the DOM.

Devkitty v1.0 focuses on doing one thing exceptionally well: delivering single-color, path-based icons with speed, clarity, and explicit behavior.

## Documentation & Getting Started

With v1.0 now live, full documentation is available, covering:

• GGDK format structure  
• The <dk-el> element and its attributes  
• Preload modes and manual loading  
• Hosting and CORS requirements  
• CDN recommendations  
• Current limitations  
• Planned roadmap features  

If you're ready to try Devkitty, head to the Getting Started page for a quick setup guide, or explore the full documentation for deeper technical details.

Everything you need to integrate Devkitty into your website is now available.

## The Beginning of Something Bigger

Version 1.0 is a stable foundation not the final destination. Future updates will expand customization, introduce multi-color support, improve tooling, and continue evolving the GGDK format while keeping the core lightweight and fast.

Devkitty v1.0 has officially launched.
