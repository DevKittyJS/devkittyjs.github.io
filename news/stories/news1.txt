[title] Test Article: January 2026
[article]

## First Look
This is the first paragraph of the article and it contains around **fifty words** to test formatting.
The goal is to verify paragraph separation, subtitle rendering, and bold text.
Everything here should appear clean and readable when rendered on the page.

This second paragraph continues the discussion with additional detail and context.
It exists to confirm that multiple paragraphs under a single subtitle are displayed correctly
without collapsing spacing or losing readability.

## Behind the Scenes
Here we introduce a new section with another subtitle.
This paragraph is written to ensure subtitles properly break content sections and
maintain visual hierarchy while still supporting **inline emphasis** and long-form text.

Another paragraph follows to further stress-test the layout.
Spacing, typography, and content flow should feel natural and balanced across the article view.

## Final Thoughts
The final section wraps things up with one last set of paragraphs.
This ensures the article renderer correctly handles the end of the document and
does not drop content or formatting near the bottom of the page.

This closing paragraph exists purely for testing purposes.
If you are reading this and everything looks correct, the system is working as intended.
