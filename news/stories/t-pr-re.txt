[title] Devkitty v1.0 Officially Released
[article]

## Devkitty v1.0 Is Here

After weeks of intense development, optimization, and testing, Devkitty finally achieves its first major milestone. The system has been designed with long-term stability and robustness in mind, the documentation has been written with care, and the engine has been thoroughly stress-tested to ensure a predictable and high-performance system. From concept to a fully functional system, it has come and today marks Devkitty's v1.0 officially lanching.

## What v1.0 Represents

Version 1.0 marks the first full public release of the Devkitty engine. A JavaScript-based vector icon system built for developers who want performance, control, and clean markup.

At its core, Devkitty introduces:

<ul>
  <li>The GGDK container format for bundling large icon packages</li>
  <li>Strict, fail-loud parsing for predictable behavior</li>
  <li>Canvas-based rendering powered by Path2D</li>
  <li>The custom &lt;dk-el&gt; element for clean HTML usage</li>
  <li>On-demand loading with multiple preload modes</li>
  <li>A DOM free of inline SVG clutter</li>
</ul>

Icons are stored in a structured GGDK file, fetched using the browser’s native fetch() API, indexed efficiently, and rendered only when requested. Hundreds of icons can live in a single file without sacrificing performance or flooding the DOM.

## Documentation & Getting Started

With v1.0 now live, full documentation is available, covering:

<ul>
  <li>GGDK format structure</li>
  <li>The &lt;dk-el&gt; element and its attributes</li>
  <li>Preload modes and manual loading</li>
  <li>Hosting and CORS requirements</li>
  <li>CDN recommendations</li>
  <li>Current limitations</li>
  <li>Planned roadmap features</li>
</ul> 

If you're ready to try Devkitty, head to the Getting Started page for a quick setup guide, or explore the full documentation for deeper technical details.

Everything you need to integrate Devkitty into your website is now available.

## The Beginning of Something Bigger

Version 1.0 is a stable foundation but not the final destination. Future updates will expand customization, introduce multi-color support and continue evolving the GGDK format while keeping the core lightweight and fast.

Devkitty v1.0 has officially launched.
